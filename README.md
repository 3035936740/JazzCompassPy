# JazzCompass

**The Digital Grimoire for Jazz Theory and Improvisation.**

`jazz_compass.py` is a comprehensive Python-based harmonic engine designed for jazz musicians, composers, and software developers. It bridges the gap between traditional music theory and algorithmic analysis, providing tools for **Chord-Scale Theory (CST)**, **Lydian Chromatic Concept (LCC)**, **Blues Toolkit**, **Negative Harmony**, and **Functional Progression Analysis**.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Advanced Chord Parsing (`ChordConverter`)

* **Extensive Library**: Supports over 60 chord types including extensions (`7#5b9`, `maj13`, `m-maj7`).
* **Slash Chord Support**: Accurately handles inversions and upper structures (e.g., `D/C`, `F/G`).
* **Enharmonic Intelligence**: Automatically standardizes sharps and flats for consistent internal logic.

### 2. Chord-Scale Theory (`CSTAnalyzer`)

* **Mode Matching**: Instantly find matching scales (Ionian, Lydian, Dorian, Altered, etc.) for any given chord.
* **Tension Analysis**: Automatically categorizes scale notes into **Available Tensions** or **Avoid Notes** (minor 9th dissonance detection).
* **Brightness Scoring**: Ranks scales based on their displacement on the Circle of Fifths.

### 3. Lydian Chromatic Concept (`LCCAnalyzer`)

* **Gravitational Logic**: Implements George Russell's LCC to find "Parent Lydian" scales.
* **Ingoing vs. Outgoing**: Ranks improvisation options by their "tonal gravity," allowing for both consonant and "outside" modern sounds.

### 4. Blues Toolkit (`BluesToolkit`)

* **Core Features**: Intelligent Scale Recommendation: Recommends parallel or relative scales based on a chord's characteristic notes (such as major third, minor seventh, #11, etc.). Supports various jazz-blues colors including Lydian Dominant, Mixolydian Blues, and Minor Blues.
* **Specific Note Generation**: Automatically translates scale theory into concrete lists of notes, making it easy for musicians to locate the notes directly on their fretboard or keyboard.
* **Tonal Color Analysis (analyze_improv_feel)**: Automatically calculates a "spiciness level" (from safe to experimental) by comparing the scale notes with the chord notes, and highlights the "tension notes" that create friction.

### 5. Harmonic Transformation & Voicing

* **Negative Harmony**: Mirror any chord or progression across the C-G axis (or any custom axis).
* **Shell & Drop 2**: Generate professional-grade piano/guitar voicings automatically.
* **Guide Tone Paths**: Calculate the $3^{rd}$ and $7^{th}$ voice-leading lines for smooth transitions.

## Quick Start

### Installation

No external dependencies required. Simply import the module into your Python environment.

```python
from jazz_compass import JazzBrain

# Initialize the engine
jazz = JazzBrain()

# 1. Generate a full harmonic report for a complex chord
jazz.get_full_report("F#m7b5")

# 2. Analyze a professional chord progression
progression = ["Cmaj7", "Ebdim7", "Dm7", "G7"]
key = jazz.find_key_center_pro(progression)
print(f"Analysis: {key}") 
# Output: Recommended Key: C Major (Ionian)

# 3. Transform a chord via Negative Harmony
neg_chord = jazz.to_negative("G7", axis="C")
print(f"Negative G7: {neg_chord}")

```

## Visualizer

The built-in terminal visualizer allows you to see the chord geometry immediately:

```text

```

## Project Structure

| Class | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `ChordConverter` | String regex parsing & interval calculation. |
| `CSTAnalyzer` | Scale definitions, brightness, and avoid-note logic. |
| `LCCAnalyzer` | Tonal gravity and Parent Lydian organization. |
| `BluesToolkit` | Improvisation guide: Blues/Pentatonic suggestions & Tension (Spiciness) analysis. |
| `JazzBrain` | The "API Layer" combining all modules for end-user reports. |

## Extension Ideas

* **MIDI Export**: Connect these classes to a MIDI library to generate backing tracks.
* **Guitar Fretboard**: Add a visualizer for 6-string fretboard positions.
* **Real-time Modulation**: Detect when a song shifts from one key center to another.
